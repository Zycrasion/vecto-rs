# Vecto-rs
This is a math library where i will dump all my data types.

## Current Status
Stable. All breaking changes will change the Major version, however i don't think this should have any in the future

I'm going to focus on the documentation and then i will think about publishing on cargo.

## Tests
Everything should be covered, if you find something that isn't covered, file an issue.

## Current Contents:
-   Vector
-   Quadtree
-   AABB ( Axis Aligned Bounding Box )
-   Useful triangle functions
-   Lines

## Using the Library
This is not available on crates.io.
In order to use this Library use this command.
```bash
cargo add --git https://github.com/Zycrasion/vecto-rs/
```

## Version
This library is currently pre 1.0.0, therefore many things may change without any warnings. I might change any public api without backwards compatibility.
